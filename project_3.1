// Project 3 Task 1
/* For this program, the goal was to print the episode that hasn't been watched 
by Yuka. This program takes user input of number of episodes and which ones were
watched and then stores that input into an array. After checking which index in 
the array hasn't been marked, it then prints the missing epidode Yuka hasn't 
watched. I used for loops to store the number of watched episdoes and an if statement
to check the missing episode for my program.
