// Project 3 Task 2
/* In this program, the coach of a debate team wants to form teams of students
 based on their proficiency on past debates. Teams are sorted into three categories:
 Beginner at 25 points, Honor at 70 points, and Excellence at 125 points. This program 
 assigns students to a team based on the one they're total points are closest to. The
 program reads user input of the number of students, and their points. It uses one array 
 to store those points and another array to store their assigned team. Then it prints the 
 students in their categorized teams.
