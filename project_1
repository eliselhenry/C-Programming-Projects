// Project 1
/* This is a program that takes input from the user regarding packages for an event venue. After
    recieving the package number, amount of guests in the party, and duration of event, the program 
    calculates and prints the cost, including food, for that event. If the cost calculated is greater 
    than the maximum charge for the event, the program will automatically throw out the calculated 
    total and instead return the maximum charge as the final cost to the user. */
